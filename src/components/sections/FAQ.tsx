      question: "How quickly can I set up automated backups?",
      answer: "Most users have their first backup running within 10 minutes. Our CLI tool and guided setup make it incredibly simple - just connect your server or database, choose a schedule, and you're done. No complex scripts or configurations required."
    },
    {
      question: "Which cloud providers and databases do you support?",
      answer: "We support all major cloud providers including AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, DigitalOcean Spaces, and Vultr Object Storage. For databases, we handle MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, and more. We also support SFTP and local storage options."
    },
    {
      question: "How secure are my backups?",
      answer: "Your data is encrypted both in transit and at rest using AES-256 encryption. We use a zero-knowledge architecture, meaning we cannot access your data even if we wanted to. All encryption keys are managed securely and uniquely per customer."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I need to restore my data?",
      answer: "Restoring is as simple as clicking a button. You can restore to any point in time within your retention period. We provide one-click restores directly to your infrastructure, or you can download backups manually. Our disaster recovery tools help you get back online quickly."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I try Novabuckups before committing to a paid plan?",
      answer: "Absolutely! We offer a 14-day free trial with full access to all features. No credit card required to start. You can test backups, try restores, and evaluate our service completely risk-free."
    },
    {
      question: "How does billing work and what's your refund policy?",
      answer: "We bill monthly or annually via Stripe. You can cancel anytime - cancellations take effect at the end of your current billing period. We offer a full refund within 14 days of your first purchase if you're not satisfied. For annual plans, we provide prorated refunds within 30 days."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you provide compliance documentation?",
      answer: "Yes, we're GDPR and UK GDPR compliant. We provide audit logs, data processing agreements (DPA), and compliance documentation needed for SOC 2, ISO 27001, and other security frameworks. Our security practices are designed for enterprise-grade compliance."
    },
    {
      question: "What kind of support do you offer?",
      answer: "We provide email support for all plans with response times within 1-2 business days. Professional and Enterprise plans get priority support. Enterprise customers also receive 24/7 phone support and a dedicated account manager."
